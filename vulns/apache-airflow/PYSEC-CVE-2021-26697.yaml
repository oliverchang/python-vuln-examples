id: PYSEC-CVE-2021-26697
package:
  name: apache-airflow
  ecosystem: PyPI
summary: Vulnerability in apache-airflow
details: The lineage endpoint of the deprecated Experimental API was not protected
  by authentication in Airflow 2.0.0. This allowed unauthenticated users to hit that
  endpoint. This is low-severity issue as the attacker needs to be aware of certain
  parameters to pass to that endpoint and even after can just get some metadata about
  a DAG and a Task. This issue affects Apache Airflow 2.0.0.
severity: MEDIUM
affects:
  ranges:
  - type: ECOSYSTEM
    fixed: 2.0.1
