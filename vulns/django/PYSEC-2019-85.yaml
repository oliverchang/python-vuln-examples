id: PYSEC-2019-85
package:
  name: django
  ecosystem: PyPI
summary: Vulnerability in django
details: Django 2.1 before 2.1.15 and 2.2 before 2.2.8 allows unintended model editing.
  A Django model admin displaying inline related models, where the user has view-only
  permissions to a parent model but edit permissions to the inline model, would be
  presented with an editing UI, allowing POST requests, for updating the inline model.
  Directly editing the view-only parent model was not possible, but the parent model's
  save() method was called, triggering potential side effects, and causing pre and
  post-save signal handlers to be invoked. (To resolve this, the Django admin is adjusted
  to require edit permissions on the parent model in order for inline models to be
  editable.)
