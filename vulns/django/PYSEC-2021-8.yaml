package:
  name: django
  ecosystem: PyPI
summary: Vulnerability in django
details: In Django 2.2 before 2.2.22, 3.1 before 3.1.10, and 3.2 before 3.2.2 (with
  Python 3.9.5+), URLValidator does not prohibit newlines and tabs (unless the URLField
  form field is used). If an application uses values with newlines in an HTTP response,
  header injection can occur. Django itself is unaffected because HttpResponse prohibits
  newlines in HTTP headers.
