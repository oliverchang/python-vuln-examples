id: PYSEC-2019-86
package:
  name: django
  ecosystem: PyPI
summary: Vulnerability in django
details: Django before 1.11.27, 2.x before 2.2.9, and 3.x before 3.0.1 allows account
  takeover. A suitably crafted email address (that is equal to an existing user's
  email address after case transformation of Unicode characters) would allow an attacker
  to be sent a password reset token for the matched user account. (One mitigation
  in the new releases is to send password reset tokens only to the registered user
  email address.)

  - type: ECOSYSTEM
