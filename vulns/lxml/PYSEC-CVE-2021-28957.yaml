package:
  name: lxml
  ecosystem: PyPI
summary: Vulnerability in lxml
details: An XSS vulnerability was discovered in python-lxml's clean module versions
  before 4.6.3. When disabling the safe_attrs_only and forms arguments, the Cleaner
  class does not remove the formaction attribute allowing for JS to bypass the sanitizer.
  A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to run arbitrary JS code on users who
  interact with incorrectly sanitized HTML. This issue is patched in lxml 4.6.3.
