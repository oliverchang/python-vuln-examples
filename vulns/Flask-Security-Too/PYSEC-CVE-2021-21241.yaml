id: PYSEC-CVE-2021-21241
package:
  name: Flask-Security-Too
  ecosystem: PyPI
summary: Vulnerability in Flask-Security-Too
details: The Python "Flask-Security-Too" package is used for adding security features
  to your Flask application. It is an is a independently maintained version of Flask-Security
  based on the 3.0.0 version of Flask-Security. In Flask-Security-Too from version
  3.3.0 and before version 3.4.5, the /login and /change endpoints can return the
  authenticated user's authentication token in response to a GET request. Since GET
  requests aren't protected with a CSRF token, this could lead to a malicious 3rd
  party site acquiring the authentication token. Version 3.4.5 and version 4.0.0 are
  patched. As a workaround, if you aren't using authentication tokens - you can set
  the SECURITY_TOKEN_MAX_AGE to "0" (seconds) which should make the token unusable.
