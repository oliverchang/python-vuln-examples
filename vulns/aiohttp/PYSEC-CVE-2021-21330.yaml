id: PYSEC-CVE-2021-21330
package:
  name: aiohttp
  ecosystem: PyPI
summary: Vulnerability in aiohttp
details: aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and Python.
  In aiohttp before version 3.7.4 there is an open redirect vulnerability. A maliciously
  crafted link to an aiohttp-based web-server could redirect the browser to a different
  website. It is caused by a bug in the `aiohttp.web_middlewares.normalize_path_middleware`
  middleware. This security problem has been fixed in 3.7.4. Upgrade your dependency
  using pip as follows "pip install aiohttp >= 3.7.4". If upgrading is not an option
  for you, a workaround can be to avoid using `aiohttp.web_middlewares.normalize_path_middleware`
  in your applications.
