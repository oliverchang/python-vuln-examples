id: PYSEC-CVE-2021-21238
package:
  name: pysaml2
  ecosystem: PyPI
summary: Vulnerability in pysaml2
details: PySAML2 is a pure python implementation of SAML Version 2 Standard. PySAML2
  before 6.5.0 has an improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability.
  All users of pysaml2 that need to validate signed SAML documents are impacted. The
  vulnerability is a variant of XML Signature wrapping because it did not validate
  the SAML document against an XML schema. This allowed invalid XML documents to be
  processed and such a document can trick pysaml2 with a wrapped signature. This is
  fixed in PySAML2 6.5.0.
